CollabEdit - Collaborative Text Editor
A real-time collaborative text editor built with C++20, featuring CRDT-based conflict resolution and cross-platform compatibility.

Overview
CollabEdit is a performant, distributed text editing system allowing multiple users to work on the same document simultaneously. Using Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs), it ensures eventual consistency without central coordination, making it resilient to network issues and enabling offline work.

Features
Real-time Collaboration

Multi-user simultaneous editing
User presence indicators and cursor tracking

Quick Start
Using the build script (Linux/macOS)
bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/collabedit.git
cd collabedit

# Build the project (installs dependencies automatically)
./build.sh

# Run tests
./build.sh --test
Manual build
bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
cmake --build . --parallel
Running the application
bash
# Start the server
./build/src/server/collabServer

# In another terminal, start the client
./build/src/client/collabEditor
Usage Example
Launch the server
Connect multiple clients to the server
Open or create a document
Start collaborative editing - all changes synchronize in real-time
Continue working offline; changes sync when reconnected
